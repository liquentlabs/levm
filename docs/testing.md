# Testing & Benchmarking Levm

This guide covers how to run Levm's tests and benchmarks, how to replay real Ethereum mainnet
blocks (including EIP-7702 transactions) through the parallel scheduler, and the environment
variables that tune execution.

## Cargo features

| Feature | Pulls in | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-utils` | mock accounts, `InMemoryDB`, execute/compare helpers, the mainnet fixture schema (`serde`, `serde_json`, `revm-primitives/serde`, `metrics-util`) | integration tests and benchmarks |
| `tools` | `test-utils` **+** a blocking HTTP client (`ureq`) | `fetch_block`, `fetch_continuous`, and `replay_mainnet` |

`tools` is kept separate from `test-utils` so the test/bench path never compiles the HTTP client,
and a normal library build (e.g. when Levm is a dependency) pulls in neither.

## Running the tests

```bash
cargo test --features test-utils
```

This builds and runs:

| Target | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| lib unit tests | core data-structure and scheduler invariants |
| `tests/erc20.rs` | ERC-20 transfer workloads |
| `tests/native_transfers.rs` | raw value-transfer workloads (independent / chained / hybrid) |
| `tests/uniswap.rs` | Uniswap swap workloads |
| `tests/eip-7702.rs` | synthetic EIP-7702 scenarios: delegate / re-delegate / reset / multi-authority; storage preservation when an already-delegated EOA with storage is re-delegated (the block-22546209 bug); and interaction with `CREATE`/`CREATE2` and `SELFDESTRUCT` |
| `tests/delegated_safety.rs` | opt-in delegated CREATE/CREATE2 and reserve-balance policy matrix; ordinary CREATE/CREATE2 compatibility, ample/exact/insufficient reserve boundaries, first-debit balance protection, authorization-refund preservation, rollback, SELFDESTRUCT, and a coordinated stale speculative read that must be invalidated and re-executed before matching sequential execution |
| `tests/mainnet.rs` | replays real mainnet blocks from fixtures (skips if none present) |

Compatibility integration tests compare **Levm parallel execution against a sequential revm
reference** and assert both per-transaction results and final bundle state. The levm-specific
delegated-safety tests use explicit expected outcomes; their combined policy matrix also compares
parallel execution against Levm's forced-sequential path.

The shared revm-compatibility helpers explicitly use `DelegatedSafetyConfig::disabled()`: mainnet
replay and upstream EIP-7702 regression tests therefore remain pure levm-vs-revm equivalence
checks even if the policy defaults change. Policy-enabled behavior is tested separately in
`tests/delegated_safety.rs`. Real-mainnet replay is strict: a sequential reference error, Levm
execution error, or skipped transaction fails immediately because every transaction included in a
canonical mainnet block is consensus-valid.

Plain `cargo test` runs the core library unit tests without optional features; the integration
targets are skipped by their `required-features` declarations. Integration suites and all
benchmarks require `--features test-utils`.

## Environment-variable knobs

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LEVM_MIN_PARALLEL_TXS` | `64` | Blocks with fewer transactions fall back to sequential. Set to `0` to force the parallel path even for tiny blocks (needed when replaying small real blocks). |
| `LEVM_FALLBACK_SEQUENTIAL` | `false` | Force sequential execution for every block. |
| `LEVM_CONCURRENT_LEVEL` | logical CPUs reported by `available_parallelism` (or `8` if unavailable) | Number of speculative execution workers. |
| `LEVM_MAINNET_BLOCKS` | `test_data/mainnet_blocks` | Directory the mainnet replay test reads single-block fixtures from. |
| `LEVM_MAINNET_BLOCK` | unset | If set, replay only this fixture number. |
| `LEVM_CONTINUOUS_BLOCKS` | `test_data/con_eth_blocks` | Directory the `continuous` bench reads merged "big block" fixtures from. |
| `LEVM_CONTINUOUS_RANGE` | unset | If set, replay only this merged-block directory name. |
| `LEVM_PRINT_METRICS` | unset | Print captured Levm metrics from replay helpers. |

Benchmark-only tuning (read by `benches/gigagas.rs`): `NUM_EOA` (default `100000`), `HOT_RATIO`
(`0.0`), `DB_LATENCY_US` (`0`), `DEPENDENCY_RATIO` (`0.1`),
`DEPENDENCY_DISTANCE` (`8`), `FILTER` (substring filter for which sub-benchmarks to run).

These execution knobs are represented by `LevmConfig` together with
`DelegatedSafetyConfig`. `Scheduler::new(...)` calls `LevmConfig::from_env()` as a convenience;
production integrations can use `Scheduler::new_with_runtime_config(...)` and
`Scheduler::execute()` to avoid process-global environment reads and make the block execution
policy explicit.

## Replaying real mainnet blocks

Levm can replay real mainnet blocks and check that parallel execution matches sequential revm on
the exact same inputs. The block's *execution environment* is downloaded over JSON-RPC and stored
as a self-contained fixture. Once downloaded, replaying that fixture needs no node or archive
database.

### 1. Fetch a block

Fetching a historical block requires an endpoint that serves historical state (typically an
archive-capable endpoint) and enables the `debug` namespace. The fetcher uses
`debug_traceBlockByNumber` with the `prestateTracer`. Find blocks containing EIP-7702 (type-4)
transactions via <https://etherscan.io/txnauthlist>.

```bash
cargo run --bin fetch_block --features tools -- <block> <rpc_url> [spec] [out_dir]
```

- `block`   — decimal (`25323281`) or hex (`0x1826711`).
- `rpc_url` — HTTP JSON-RPC endpoint.
- `spec`    — optional hardfork override (e.g. `Prague`); inferred from the block timestamp otherwise.
- `out_dir` — optional output root (default `test_data/mainnet_blocks`).

This writes `test_data/mainnet_blocks/<block>/{block,txs,pre_state}.json`.

### 2. Run the replay

```bash
# Replay every single-block fixture under test_data/mainnet_blocks/
LEVM_MIN_PARALLEL_TXS=0 cargo test --features test-utils --test mainnet replay_mainnet_blocks

# Replay every hardfork-boundary fixture under test_data/spec_coverage/
LEVM_MIN_PARALLEL_TXS=0 LEVM_MAINNET_BLOCKS=test_data/spec_coverage \
  cargo test --features test-utils --test mainnet replay_mainnet_blocks

# Replay just one block
LEVM_MIN_PARALLEL_TXS=0 LEVM_MAINNET_BLOCK=25323281 \
  cargo test --features test-utils --test mainnet replay_mainnet_blocks
```

`LEVM_MIN_PARALLEL_TXS=0` forces the parallel path even though real blocks are frequently smaller
than 64 transactions. Without `LEVM_MAINNET_BLOCK` the test loads every fixture under
`LEVM_MAINNET_BLOCKS` and asserts parallel == sequential for each.

### 3. Pipelined discover-and-replay (`replay_mainnet`)

To validate many real blocks without committing fixtures, the `replay_mainnet` binary discovers
blocks over RPC and replays each in-process, prefetching the next block while replaying the current
one (a background thread fetches block N+1 while the main thread replays block N):

```bash
cargo run --bin replay_mainnet --features tools -- <rpc_url> [filter] [start_block] [count] [out_dir]
```

Blocks are scanned **upward** toward the chain head.

- `filter`      — which blocks to replay:
  - `all` (default): every non-empty block;
  - `eip-7702`: blocks with a type-4 transaction;
  - `delegated-safety`: candidate blocks where an EIP-7702 delegated state context creates a
    contract or moves balance through CALL/SELFDESTRUCT. This uses the built-in `callTracer` plus
    batched historical `eth_getCode` calls, so it works with providers that reject custom
    JavaScript tracers.
- `start_block` — where to start scanning. Default: the mainnet EIP-7702 activation block
  (`22431084`, Pectra, 2025-05-07).
- `count`       — how many matching blocks to replay. Default: **all** of them up to the chain head.
- `out_dir`     — optional. If given, each replayed block's fixture is written to
  `<out_dir>/<number>/`. Omitted ⇒ fetched in memory only, **nothing is written to disk** (so the
  "all" mode doesn't fill the disk with millions of fixtures).

```bash
# Replay every EIP-7702 block since activation (large job — dominated by one
# debug_traceBlockByNumber per block; interrupt any time), in memory only:
cargo run --bin replay_mainnet --features tools -- <rpc_url> eip-7702

# Find and replay the first delegated CREATE/CREATE2/balance-movement candidate:
cargo run --bin replay_mainnet --features tools -- \
  <rpc_url> delegated-safety 22431084 1

# Replay 20 (any) blocks from a height AND persist them under test_data/mainnet_blocks/:
cargo run --bin replay_mainnet --features tools -- <rpc_url> all 25323281 20 test_data/mainnet_blocks
```

Each block is validated as it arrives, and its **execution-only** times (the inputs are already in
memory, so neither figure includes RPC/file I/O) are printed per block and accumulated into a final
aggregate parallel-vs-sequential speedup. On the **first** invalid replay input, sequential/Levm
execution error, skipped transaction, or result divergence, it prints the offending block and
exits non-zero. Without `out_dir` nothing is written to disk — use `fetch_block` or pass `out_dir`
to persist a fixture.

> Note: with an in-memory fixture the database has ~zero read latency, so the measured speedup is
> compute-bound and understates the win on a real node, where parallel execution also hides storage
> I/O latency.

### Oracle & scope

The replay oracle is **parallel == sequential on identical inputs**. It is intentionally *not*
mainnet-state-root faithful:

- Block-level system calls (EIP-4788/2935/7002/7251) and withdrawals are not applied (they are not
  part of the transaction list).
- Blob gas price is pinned to the protocol minimum (this revm build models blob fees up to Prague
  only), so type-3 transactions are never spuriously rejected.

Two inputs that `prestateTracer` does **not** report are captured separately so transactions that
depend on them still replay faithfully:

- the last 256 block hashes (for the `BLOCKHASH` opcode), and
- the code of EIP-7702 delegation targets (the contract executed when a delegated account is called;
  collected from each type-4 tx's `authorization_list` and from existing `0xef0100` designators).

Both executors see exactly the same environment, so the comparison stays valid regardless.

## Merged "big block" benchmark

To stress single-block parallelism beyond what one real block provides, `fetch_continuous` merges a
range of consecutive blocks into one oversized block: all transactions are concatenated, their
prestate read sets merged, a single (lowest-basefee) block environment is chosen, and any
transaction that cannot execute under that merged environment is filtered out.

```bash
# Merge `count` consecutive blocks starting at `start` into test_data/con_eth_blocks/<start>_<end>/
cargo run --bin fetch_continuous --features tools -- <start> <count> <rpc_url> [out_dir]

# Benchmark Levm parallel vs revm sequential over the merged block(s)
cargo bench --features test-utils --bench continuous

# Replay them as a correctness test (all ranges, or one via LEVM_CONTINUOUS_RANGE)
LEVM_MIN_PARALLEL_TXS=0 cargo test --features test-utils --test mainnet replay_continuous_blocks
LEVM_MIN_PARALLEL_TXS=0 LEVM_CONTINUOUS_RANGE=25326115_25326124 \
  cargo test --features test-utils --test mainnet replay_continuous_blocks
```

The `continuous` benchmark first verifies parallel == sequential on each big block, then times both.
It skips cleanly when no fixtures are present. For a ~1-gigagas block, merge roughly 30+ blocks.

## Benchmarks

```bash
# Synthetic workloads (ERC-20, Uniswap, raw transfers, hybrid)
JEMALLOC_SYS_WITH_MALLOC_CONF="thp:always,metadata_thp:always" \
NUM_EOA=<n> HOT_RATIO=<r> DB_LATENCY_US=<us> \
cargo bench --features test-utils --bench gigagas

# Real merged mainnet block(s) (see above)
cargo bench --features test-utils --bench continuous
```

## `test_data/` layout & fetching the fixtures

The fixtures live in a separate repository,
[`levm-test-data`](https://github.com/liquentlabs/levm-test-data), wired in as a **git submodule** at
`test_data/`. It is marked with `update = none` in `.gitmodules` so Cargo does not download the
large test-only repository when Levm is used as a Git dependency. Levm developers and CI jobs
that run the fixture-backed suites must opt in explicitly:

```bash
# Fresh clone:
git clone <levm-url>
cd levm

# Fetch the fixtures at the commit pinned by Levm. This one-command override does not persist.
git -c submodule.test_data.update=checkout \
  submodule update --init test_data
```

When the submodule is not checked out, the mainnet replay test and the `continuous` benchmark skip
gracefully.

```
test_data/
├── mainnet_blocks/<block>/{block,txs,pre_state}.json        # single real blocks (fetch_block)
├── spec_coverage/<block>/{block,txs,pre_state}.json         # hardfork-boundary regression set
└── con_eth_blocks/<start>_<end>/{block,txs,pre_state}.json   # merged big blocks (fetch_continuous)
```

Each fixture is self-contained (account code is stored inline) and uses Levm's own stable JSON
schema (see `src/test_utils/common/mainnet.rs`) rather than serializing revm's internal types, so it
survives revm upgrades.

> When you add new fixtures: commit & push them in the `levm-test-data` repo, then in this repo
> `cd test_data && git checkout <new-commit>`, `git add test_data`, and commit the bumped submodule
> pointer so CI / fresh checkouts pick up the new data.
